# Biography

I (Nate) am a Ph.D. student studying clinical psychology at The Ohio State University. I am interested in the role that emotion plays in how humans processes, learn from, and make decisions based on rewards. Additionally, I am interested in how decision making can go wrong, specifically in the case of drug addiction and other externalizing disorders. [My lab](http://tpb.psy.ohio-state.edu/LAP/people.htm) studies these processes across the lifespan, beginning with ADHD in early childhood to antisocial personality disorders in adulthood. 

To study the above topics, I use methods such as hierarchical modeling (within a Bayesian framework) and machine learning. I believe that to understand both healthy and unhealthy development, it is crucial that we use all the information that we have available, and these methods help accomplish that in a formalized way.
