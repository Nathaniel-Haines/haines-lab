      <description>The Reliability Paradox Defining Reliability In 2017, Hedge, Powell, and Sumner (2017) conducted a study to determine the reliability of a variety of of behavioral tasks. Reliability has many different meanings throughout the psychological literature, but what Hedge et al.Â were interested in was how well a behavioral measure consistently ranks individuals. In other words, when I have people perform a task and then measure their performance, does the measure that I use to summarize their behavior show high test-retest reliability?</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, we will explore frequentist and Bayesian analogues of regularized/penalized linear regression models (e.g., LASSO [L1 penalty], Ridge regression [L2 penalty]), which are an extention of traditional linear regression models of the form:
\[y = \beta_{0}+X\beta + \epsilon\tag{1}\] where \(\epsilon\) is the error, which is normally distributed as:
\[\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)\tag{2}\] Unlike these traditional linear regression models, regularized linear regression models produce biased estimates for the \(\beta\) weights.</description>
